            <h2>Majorville!</h2>
            <p>Majorville is located on Lake Michigan where Pine Creek empties into Lake Michigan just south of Esky Road.  Today this is one of the most popular swimming beaches in the Lakeshore, but in the 1870s and 1880s, Majorville was a booming lumber town!</p>

            <p>
                By the late 1850s, Lumber speculators were on their way north as the forests near Grand Haven and Muskegon were harvested. Dr. Arthur O&apos;Leary, recognized the financial potential of the timber stands around Pine Creek. He began buying up large tracts of forest and made plans to build a sawmill. Mill operation began in 1869 for the purpose of producing white pine lumber, and the town of Majorville was established.
